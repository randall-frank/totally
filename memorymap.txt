Issues:
  Game too easy, scores too high


GetInputBtn -> can be JSR 1Df0 or LDA C000   ReadJoystickBtn


DivideBy7 - divide Acc by 7 Convert X pos into byte(X),bits(Y)
return remainder in Y, divisor in X

Images are generally pre-shifted tables. 

3 bytes/scanline, 9 rows -> 27 bytes/img + 5 unused bytes = 32bytes/image

Columns:
$1D=last white bar
$21=current score and "fuel bar"
$25=highscore and "ships"



This was the original program layout in memory.  There were a LOT of unused
pages, etc between things.  Moving to assembly (from raw binary), most of
those issues have been addressed and the assembly code is MUCH tighter now.

$0C00 - program start - setup display, read highscores from disk
$0D00 - play a game
$0D79 - next level 

$1000 - scanline HI table
$10C0 - scanline LO table

$1900 - MassDraw 'highscore' image routine
$1930 - image data

$1B00 - ExplodeImage0 Explosion images ($20/image) 3 images

$1F00 - ship images = $20*7 = $E0 bytes

$2000 - $3fff screen

$4790 - Phase 1 Boss Image (2 bytes wide, 16 bytes tall = $20bytes)

$4900 - Massdraw Game over image draw
$4930 - image data

$4c00 - Main loop, display high score
$4c03 - Begin new game (K)eyboard, (J)oystick 

$55f0 - MassDraw game title
$5700 - image data

$6200 - initial dots X table
$6210 - initial dots Y table
$6400 - current dots X table
$6410 - current dots Y table

$6700 - I/O Buffer for highscores

$7000 - "entity" images - 32 bytes/image, 1 image/level, 16 levels
      - preshifted images 256 bytes/level ($1000 bytes)
$8000 - EOF

Note: there may be 20 entities in the source

TODO: 

rework DrawExplodeImage to allow other than $1B00
rework DrawPlayerShip to allow other than $1F00
replace divide by 7 with tables
replace random number generator $6900,$6A00?
